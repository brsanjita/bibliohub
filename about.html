Bibliohub is a book review website launched in 2019 by the students of ECM, SNIST. <br>
This webiste is built to provide a deep understanding of the various genre of books available in the market and also to provide book reviews to help rthe user purchase oa book of their choice. </br>
We as students personally encountered a lot of issues choosing the right book and finding an apt review of it. Hence, launching a website which could provide information to budding readers felt like an ideal decision to take up.</br>
